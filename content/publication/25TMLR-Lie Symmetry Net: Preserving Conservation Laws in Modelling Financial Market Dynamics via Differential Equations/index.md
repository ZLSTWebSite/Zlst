abstract: 'This paper employs a novel Lie symmetries-based framework to model the intrinsic symmetries within financial market. Specifically, we introduce {\it Lie symmetry net} (LSN), which characterises the Lie symmetries of the  differential equations (DE) estimating financial market dynamics, such as the Black-Scholes equation.
To simulate these differential equations in a symmetry-aware manner, LSN incorporates a Lie symmetry risk derived from the conservation laws associated with the Lie symmetry operators of the target differential equations. This risk measures how well the Lie symmetries are realised and guides the training of LSN under the structural risk minimisation framework. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that LSN effectively realises the Lie symmetries and achieves an error reduction of more than {\it one order of magnitude} compared to state-of-the-art methods.'
